### Limitations
- :heavy_exclamation_mark: This Action is still very experimental :heavy_exclamation_mark:
- Be careful with sensative data inside the guest. The guests are deployed with untrusted/unverified images.
- Only `run.shell=bash` steps are propogated to the guest at the moment. `run.shell=python` will run in the host.
- No support for Actions; just `run` steps.
- Do not use this Action on non-ephemeral self-hosted runners. It is designed primarily for GitHub-hosted runners.
